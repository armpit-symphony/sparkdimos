"""Manipulator drivers for robotic arms.

Architecture: Protocol-based adapters for different manipulator hardware.
- spec.py: ManipulatorAdapter Protocol and shared types
- xarm/: XArm adapter
- piper/: Piper adapter
- mock/: Mock adapter for testing

Usage:
    >>> from lima.hardware.manipulators.xarm import XArm
    >>> arm = XArm(ip="192.168.1.185")
    >>> arm.start()
    >>> arm.enable_servos()
    >>> arm.move_joint([0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0])

Testing:
    >>> from lima.hardware.manipulators.xarm import XArm
    >>> from lima.hardware.manipulators.mock import MockAdapter
    >>> arm = XArm(adapter=MockAdapter())
    >>> arm.start()  # No hardware needed!
